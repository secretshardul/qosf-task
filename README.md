# Task 3

[**Task 3 code**](./task3.ipynb)

A program to simulate quantum circuits in Python. It lets you:

1. Create a quantum circuit in ground state
2. Generate operation matrices from `X`, `H` and `CX` quantum gates
3. Apply operations on the ciruit and get resultant state
4. Measure the final circuit state

## Bonus tasks
Both bonus tasks have been implemented:

1. Parametric gates
2. Global params

To run these, look at the driver code and uncomment the appropriate parts.
